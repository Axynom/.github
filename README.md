# Axynom Protocol

Axynom is a decentralized coordination protocol designed to reward real contribution through transparent, on-chain systems. Built without VCs, gatekeeping, or shortcuts, Axynom empowers builders, creators, and promoters to grow ecosystems and earn meaningful rewards.

## Vision

We believe that protocols should grow from participation — not speculation.

Axynom introduces the Proof-of-Growth (PoG) system, where users earn Growth Points (GP) for real impact, not hype. GP can be redeemed for AXY tokens, used to access rewards, and serves as a permanent record of reputation.

The protocol combines staking, contribution tracking, community curation, and sustainable incentives in a modular, upgradeable design — starting on Arbitrum and expanding into a full coordination stack.

## Highlights

- Modular, proxy-safe smart contract system (Solidity)
- Growth Points (GP) system for tracking and rewarding contributions
- On-chain registry for all protocol contributions
- Flexible staking contract with reward tiers, penalties, and boosts
- Treasury and reward pool structure for long-term sustainability
- Forum integration for decentralized contribution reviews

## Status

Axynom is currently in public testnet and contributor onboarding phase. All contracts and systems are subject to review, iteration, and audit before mainnet deployment.
